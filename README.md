## What's this? üßê

This project is meant to be a full 64bit operating system. If you came across this project just by coincidence and you have experience 
working on low-level systems, embedded systems, and related stuff, feel free to contribute and to contact me via Discord. 

The project is not intended to be finished in a short period of time, I'm currently a Computer Engineering student and I don't know everything, part of this
project is meant for you, the people out there in the industry, and the academia who have lots of experience, to help me achieve the goal of finishing this project.

I'll be honored if you reach out to me, and guide me throughout this process, I hope I learn lots from you, as well as I hope you learn from me. Please, don't hesitate to contact me on Discord. 

In the future, I may do some Devlog on YouTube so that we can reach out to some new people and create a good community across this project. 
If you want to know more, please, join my Discord server, I¬¥m so looking forward to collaborating with you :) 

## What's next? ü§î
- First of all, we have to create a bootloader, I'll use the Assembly language in order to get something up and running, remember, I'm a student, and by any means
I'm no expert, if you see even the smallest flaw, be confident and create a new issue, so that we all know what to improve. 


PS: The name of the project(and therefore the name of the operating system) will change in the future, it's just a temporary name. By the way, I use CLion as my IDE for C and C++ programming, that's why the .idea folder in the source files. Please try to be as consistent as possible so that we all can run the project with no issues across as many systems as possible, as of May 2021 I'll be doing most of the job on this project on Linux, take that into account after you have cloned the repo and try to execute it on your system. I'll add a CONTRIBUTING file later for more details.
